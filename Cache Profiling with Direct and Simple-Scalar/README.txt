Instructions :
Go to the folder Direct or Simple-scalar. Select the task you wish to see. After selecting you must be able to see 2 folders named Linear and Random.Choose whether you want to see the linear access results or the random access results and then go to that folder. After moving the folder select the operation you want to perform i.e. whether read or write and move to that corresponding folder. After going to the folder you must see a file named Makefile. Type “make” in your terminal and you'll be asked to enter the size of the array whose results you wish to see. After you enter the size see the result for that size.

Please Note : With the -Wall flag, I see that variable dummy  is unused, although it is used. Please ignore this.
